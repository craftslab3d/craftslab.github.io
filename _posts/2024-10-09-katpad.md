Introducing the KatPad...

A sleek, custom macropad that perfectly complements your workspace. Crafted with a 3D-printed body in ICED PETG, this durable yet aesthetic design is a stunning addition to any desk setup. The 128x64 OLED Display provides all the information you need, from key maps to encoder settings, animations, and status updates. Equipped with a modern USB-C connection, it comes with a stylish curled USB-C to USB-A cable for seamless connectivity. Powered by an ESP32 dual-core microcontroller and running on the SUGOI Macropad Firmware developed by Crafts Lab 3D, it offers unparalleled functionality. With 9 programmable keys plus 2 on the encoder, you can program up to 20 layers and 100 macros. The Kailh low-profile hot-swappable mechanical switches ensure a satisfying and customizable typing experience. Plus, you won’t need to rely on third-party software—the KatPad comes with its own embedded programmer software, offering a fully integrated and effortless customization experience.
